In Next.js 15, App Router introduces a new way to handle routing. A common error is related to the `fetch` function within the `async` function, especially when trying to access data during the rendering phase.  Incorrect placement of the `fetch` call (e.g., outside an `async` function, or an incorrect use of `await`) might lead to unexpected behavior and errors. The error might manifest as a missing data or an error related to accessing `undefined` properties.
