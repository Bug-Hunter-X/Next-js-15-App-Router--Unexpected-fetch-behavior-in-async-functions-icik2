# Next.js 15 App Router: Unexpected Fetch Behavior in Async Functions

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `fetch` function within `async` functions in Next.js 15's App Router.  The problem arises from the incorrect placement or handling of asynchronous operations during the rendering process.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when a `fetch` call intended to retrieve data for rendering is not properly handled using `await` inside an `async` function.  This can lead to `undefined` values or render errors.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `fetch` call is properly awaited within an `async` function, guaranteeing the data is retrieved before rendering. The `use` keyword is used for error handling. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the errors or unexpected behavior.
